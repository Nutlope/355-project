# RISC-V Simulator

This is a Simulator that runs assembly code using RISC-V architecture, written as a project for a computer architecture class. Project 1 takes in assembly code and produces machine binary code. Project 2 simulates a datapath. It takes in assembly instructions and runs them through a simulation before executing them.
