# RISC-V Simulator

This is a Simulator coded in C that runs assembly code using RISC-V architecture, written as a project for a computer architecture class.

Project 1 contains a program that takes in assembly code and produces machine binary code. It looks up instructions in cpu_traces and produces the binary code in a terminal upon running.

Project 2 simulates a datapath. It takes in assembly instructions and runs them through a simulation of how a CPU would typically behave before executing them.
